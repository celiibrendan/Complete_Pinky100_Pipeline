Brainstorming changes:
0) Check to see that the leftover pieces has any vertices
--> if there are then display a message and write empty vertices and faces array to the table
1) Always import the neuron from proofread label
2) Import the leftover pieces and don't color them
3) Only label the leftover pieces
3) When done, write the leftover labels to the datajoint table
- Delete the larger neuron
