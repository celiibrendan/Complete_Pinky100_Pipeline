pinky.SynapseCompartmentSpineLabelRevised 
- has both of the spine and compartment label for a synapse combine

NeuriteTargetsRevised
- uses the pinky.SynapseCompartmentSpineLabelRevised in order to compute the percentages
of where axons synapse onto for every neurite
-- this data will be used to perform the clusters

SpineClusters:
- calculates the different cluster groups based on teh Neurites target table

heat_map_pinky:
- does the heat map of the different fingerprints from the certain clusters
